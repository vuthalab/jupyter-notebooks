# Jupyter notebooks

This repo contains Python code, with accompanying equations and plots, to describe commonly performed lab tasks. So far there are notebooks for

* Calculating power spectral densities from voltages measured by an ADC
* Using ABCD matrices to understand ray transformations through an optical system
* Mode-matching a gaussian beam to an optical cavity

More soon ...
